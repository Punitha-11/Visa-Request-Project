  <p> <h1> Before you pack your bags, read this!</h1><br>

  <h3>When it comes to international travel right now, the world isn't exactly anyone's oyster -- but it could be your cocktail shrimp. In other words, many countries are still closed to tourists, but plenty of great destinations are finally, slowly opening their doors. But before you pack your bags, here's some post-COVID travel tips to keep in mind....</h3><br>
 


 <h2>You're probably going to need to be vaccinated<h2><br>
 <h3>What with Covaxin still not appearing in the EUL of the WHO, it'd be safer to bet on getting a Covishield jab, if you want to set foot on foreign soil. Even if you're headed to a country that doesn't require travellers to be vaccinated, unvaccinated travellers will likely have to jump through many more hoops. Some countries will require that unvaccinated travellers quarantine on arrival (and, yes, you'll pay for that yourself). At the very least, you'll probably need to take multiple COVID-19 tests if you don't have proper vaccination documentation.</h3><br>

   <h2>Testing is common -- and at your own expense</h2><br>

  <h3>Speaking of testing, be prepared to show a negative COVID-19 test result before you travel. In fact, many countries will require a negative test before you arrive, even if you're vaccinated. Most countries require the test to be done no more than 72 hours before your arrival. In any case, the cost comes out of your pocket. So be sure your personal finance budget is prepared.</h3><br>
 


  <h2>Country hopping may not be possible</h2><br>
   <h3>If you're looking forward to a multi-country trip, you may need to think again. While some countries will be open to visitors regardless of where they've been, most countries will want to know everywhere you've been in the past 10 to 14 days. Be sure to check out entry/exit requirements for every country on your to-visit list.</h3><br>
 

   <h2>Masks are still required in most countries</h2><br>
   <h3>This one is a no-brainer! Take as many fresh masks as you'll need to last your entire trip.</h3><br>

  <h2>Be prepared for curfews, closures, and capacity limits</h2><br>
  <h3> A number of countries are still under various forms of lockdowns, even if they're open to tourists. In some places, this means strict curfews on travel after dark. This could also mean certain businesses are still closed, either entirely or in part. For example, restaurants may be open to takeout, but won't allow you to sit inside and eat. Another thing to plan on is capacity limits, especially in popular tourist stops. Plan to be flexible about where and when you can drop in on certain attractions.</h3><br>
 


  <h2>Travel health insurance is required in many countries</h2><br>
  <h3>It's always a good idea to carry some kind of health insurance when you travel. Even if you're fine with risking it without insurance, your destination country may not be. Some countries will require that you have proof of medical coverage adequate to cover coronavirus-related care before you'll be allowed into the country.</h3><br>
 

  <h2>You'll need a negative test to come back home</h2><br>
 <h3> Although restrictions in India are being lifted in many areas in a phased out manner, we're not so lax at the border! If you leave the country and travel abroad, you'll need to show a negative COVID-19 test before you can return. So, be sure you get tested (negative!) before you return home.<br><br>
 

Traveling abroad is rarely simple, even when there isn't a global pandemic, but it's significantly more complicated right now, even in countries with few restrictions. Be sure to plan your trip thoroughly, including researching any and all destinations on your agenda. And don't forget about local restrictions. It's good to be familiar with country-wide rules, but local cities or towns may also have additional requirements you'll need to be aware of. <br><br>

 Cherish your trip for all that it's worth! </h3></p><br>
